This is the course material for Statistical Methods in the Physical Sciences. To easily run and modify the code examples and do the challenges and 'intuition builders', you will need to open a jupyter notebook (with magic command `%matplotlib inline` or `%matplotlib notebook` in the first cell to enable inline or interactive plotting), or another Python interpreter/IDE of your choice.


> ## Prerequisites
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.

### Getting Started
To get started, follow the directions on the "[Setup](setup/)" page to download data
and install an up-to-date Python installation such as Anaconda if you need to (including a jupyter notebook or another Python interpreter). For this course you will need to ensure that you 
have Numpy, Scipy and Pandas in your Python installation (Anaconda includes all three)
